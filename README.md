# Bradley Jester's Portfolio Website 

## Description

As a current student of the UW Professional & Continuing Education Coding Boot Camp, I was motivated to build a website to showcase my current and future portfolio projects. I built this website for hiring managers and recruiters, that way they can get a sense of my skills and abilities. I also built this website for my family and friends, that way they can get a feel for the type of work I am doing in Coding Boot Camp. Through building this website, I am now able to showcase my deployed web applications. Also, it was through building this website that I begun to learn about responsive web design and UI/UX design principles. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

A few things to note:

- If you click on my name in the upper left-hand corner of the header, it redirects you to the home page.
- On smaller screens, you can toggle the navigation bar and a drop-down menu of the different webpages on the site appear.
- If you click on the Font Awesome GitHub and LinkedIn icons in the footer, it redirects you to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
- In the Work section, click on the images to be redirected to my deployed web applications.
- Make sure to fill out every section in the Contact Me! form, or else you will be unable to send me a message.
